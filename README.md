# Responive Website Studio42
## A responsive website for a fictitious music studio

This website was created with the aim of making maximum use of responsive web design.<br/>
For this purpose, a webpage was created for a fictitious studio.<br/>
The page contains some features, such as the auto-slider for the references.<br/> 
Since common page builders are not able to display responsive webdesign<br/>
with such accuracy, the page was written from scratch.

The page can be viewed under the following [Link](https://schmitzgoogledriveweblinks.on.drv.tw/Studio42/ "Studio42").
